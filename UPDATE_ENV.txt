# After you get MongoDB connection string from Atlas:

# 1. Copy your connection string (looks like):
# mongodb+srv://admin:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/lead-capture?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# 2. Update the .env file with your connection string

# 3. Restart backend server (Ctrl+C then: npm start)

# 4. Test the form - it should now work!

# QUICK TEST:
# Open Terminal and run:
# curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"message":"Backend is running"}

# Then test the form at http://localhost:3000
